#### Roles and responsibilities

| Role | Name | Tasks/Work |

#### Entry criteria:

-	functional business specifications are defined

#### Exit criteria:

-	all test cases have been executed 
-	90% of tests are passed
-	no Critical issues/bugs have Open status (All unresolved bugs have low priority and low severity)
-	exploratory testing performed on the features: Add funds, Withdraw funds, Send money
-	update tests are 100% passed (update tests will not generate other new issues that impact the application)
  
#### Risks:

-	user data (banking related data, funds, transactions, etc) might be impacted with update tests
-	stability risks (crashes, disconnects, etc)
-	IE browser might have performance issues
-	versions of IE older than 1.5923e have security vulnerabilities (we could mention what vulnerabilities are)
-	the web page pagination could be impacted when opened on mobile devices
-	stress conditions might impact the web application
-	new browser might not be supported

  ### 2.2 Test analysis
